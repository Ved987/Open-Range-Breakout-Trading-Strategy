# Open-Range-Breakout-Trading-Strategy
The open range breakout (ORB) strategy is a popular trading technique used by day traders to identify potential trading opportunities. This strategy is based on the concept that the price of an asset tends to move outside of its opening range in the early hours of trading, which can indicate a significant price move for the rest of the day.

The ORB strategy involves identifying the high and low price range of an asset within the first few minutes of trading, usually the first 30 minutes. Once the range is identified, traders will wait for the price to move outside of this range, either above the high or below the low, before entering a trade.

I have implemented this strategy using a basic python code which runs on the data downloaded in the execel sheet attached. This code is oly used to backtest the strategy and not real time automated. Just clone the repo and run the python file. An example image for the output is also attached.
